==============
Institution
==============
TeSLA CE allows to define multiple institutions. Each institution will be treated
in a independent way, having their learners, instructors and users. The computation
resources will be shared. New institutions can be created, updated and deleted using
the administration API. Once created, institutions can be managed by their administrators.

Informed Consent
================
The "Informed Consent" is the legal document a learner must accept before any data from learner is captured.
Informed Consents belong to institutions, and are ordered by a version value as "X.Y.Z". When the institution informed
consent changes in the first two positions (X, Y), it is considered a major change, and invalidate previous
informed consent, what means all learners need to accept the new one before submitting any new data.
Small changes, like typos can be generated as minor changes. In this case, where only the Z
value changes, the system will suggest learners to update the informed consent, but will allow them to continue.
For each informed consent, the legal document in different languages can be stored.

Course Groups
=============
Course groups allow institutions to organize their courses in bigger groups. Each course group can have many courses
from the different VLEs of the institution and other groups. In this way, courses can be organized in semesters, degrees,
department or any other structure useful for the institution.

The only requirement for the course groups is to maintain a hierarchical structure without cycles.

SEND

Institutions can define categories for Special Education Needs and Disabilities. Each category defines a set
of options and a list of instruments that will be disabled. This allow the system to automatically adapts to
the SEND requirements of each learner.

Learners
========
Learners are a type of Institution Users. In addition to the information of the institution user,
each learner is provided with a learner_id value of type UUIDv4 that identifies this learner in a
unique manner in the TeSLA instance. This learner_id is provided to external services, like
data validators and instrument providers, which allows to prevent sharing the personal information
from learners.
